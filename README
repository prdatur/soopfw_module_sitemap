Soopfw module: Sitemap
----------------------

Sitemap is a SoopFw extension.
It will generate a sitemap for you which you an use for example within google.
It generates the sitemap based up on the standard of http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html.

Modules which want to provide sitemap entries need to implement two hooks.

The first is "sitemap_section" which returns all sections for this module.
The next one is "sitemap_get_entries" which returns all entries based up on the section.
